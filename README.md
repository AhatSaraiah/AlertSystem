Vehicle Management System


## Description
The Vehicle Management System is a sophisticated landing page developed using TypeScript and Angular. It provides a comprehensive interface for managing and organizing vehicle data in a dynamic table format. Users can upload an Excel file containing vehicle information, and the system intelligently sorts the data based on the nearest expiration date. Vehicles with expiration dates within one month are highlighted with an approaching status, enabling users to easily identify and prioritize upcoming maintenance or renewals. The system also automatically detects and updates the status of expired dates.
